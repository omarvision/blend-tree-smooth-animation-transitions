# blend-tree-smooth-animation-transitions
I have a walk animation for a cat. I have an idle animation for a cat. I made the animations and the cat in blender. In Unity we use 'Blend Tree' to partially play animation idle, walk - blending them together smoothly so the cat goes from idle to walk and even walk backwards without having to use more than two animations.  It's a nice smooth animation transition.
